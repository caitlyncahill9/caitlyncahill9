Hi! My name is Caitlyn Cahill. I am a junior at Cornell univeristy pursuing a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a minor in business. 
I am looking to expand my CS knowledge in new fields and develop skills that 
can help me improve my understanding of the field while contributing to a 
project as part of a professional team. My GutHub is still being added to,
but this contains some of my personal and class group projects from the 
past 5 semesters!
